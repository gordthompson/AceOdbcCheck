# AceOdbcCheck

A simple VBScript to check if the "ACE" Access Database Engine (`Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)`) is available to non-Office applications on a Windows machine.

On a 64-bit Windows machine, the `.vbs` file extension will most likely be associated with the 64-bit version of WSCRIPT.EXE. The script will detect if it is being run as 64-bit, and if the test fails then you will have the option of re-running the test in 32-bit mode.

## How to use it

Download the zip file at

https://github.com/gordthompson/AceOdbcCheck/releases/latest

Right-click it and choose "Extract all...", then double-click the .vbs file.
